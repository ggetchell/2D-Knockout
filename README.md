## Synopsis

This is a game created from a tutorial on HTML gaming projects, i don't specifically recall the site. I enjoyes creating this game as i use it along with others to be able to learn javascript a little better. The game also reminds me of the Atari game pong, however it is alot better and faster than previous. I am trying to figure ways to modify the game to make it keep score as well as prompt input as to "play again or quit".


## Motivation

I chose this one due to the fact there wasn't 16 pages of code for this game, and i seem to like simple games. It did help me to understand javascript a little better. I hope you will enjoy it as well.
